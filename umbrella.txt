Umbrella (feat. Jay-Z) / Rihanna
--------------------------------
Jay-Z:
Ahuh Ahuh (Chyea)
Ahuh Ahuh (Good girl gone bad)
Ahuh Ahuh (Take three...)
Ahuh (Action)
Ahuh Ahuh

No clouds in my stones
Let it rain
I hydroplane in the bank (Eh eh)
Comin' down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come we gone
We Roc-a-fellas (Eh eh)
She fly higher than the weather
And she flies it better
You know me
In anticipation for precipitation
stacks chips for the rainy day (Eh eh)
Jay, rain man is back with little Ms. Sunshine
Rihanna where you at?


[VERSE 1]
You had my heart
and we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
but you'll still be my star
Baby cause in the Dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because

[CHORUS]
When the sun shines
Weâ€™ll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath
Im'ma stick it out 'till the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we still have each other
You can stand under my Umbrella
You can stand under my Umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh)

[VERSE 2]
These fancy things,
will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for Infinity
When the war has took it's part
When the world has dealt it's cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because ...

[CHORUS]
When the sun shines
We'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath
Im'ma stick it out 'till the end


Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we still have each other
You can stand under my Umbrella
You can stand under my Umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh)

[BRIDGE]
You can run into my Arms
It's okay don't be alarmed
Come into Me
There's no distance in between our love
So Gonna let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
Yeah
Because ...

[CHORUS]
When the sun shines
We'll shine Together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath
Im'ma stick it out 'till the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we still have each other
You can stand under my Umbrella
You can stand under my Umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(ella ella eh eh eh eh eh eh)
